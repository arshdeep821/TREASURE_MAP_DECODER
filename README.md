# Treasure Map Decoder Algorithm

### Arshdeep Jaggo ###

### Project *Details* and *Description*:
Used breadth-first traversal on individual pixels of an image to find the shortest path to the point that is farthest from the start in the embedded maze.
The original maze path can not be seen by the naked eye due to little difference between solution pixels and non-solution pixels.
